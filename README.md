# Predictive Employee Turnover: Cleaning and Preparing HR Data for Model Building

## Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing messy HR data to build a predictive model for employee turnover.  The goal is to identify employees at risk of leaving the company, allowing for proactive interventions to improve employee retention. This repository contains the data cleaning and preparation scripts, enabling the creation of a clean dataset suitable for model building.  The analysis performed includes handling missing values, outlier detection, feature engineering, and data transformation to improve model accuracy and interpretability.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (potentially, depending on included model building steps - mention if used)


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:**  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


## Example Output

The script will print summary statistics and data cleaning steps to the console.  It will also generate visualizations (if any are included in the project), such as histograms and correlation matrices, which will be saved as PNG files in the `output` directory (create this directory if it doesn't exist).  The cleaned and prepared dataset will be saved as a CSV file (e.g., `cleaned_hr_data.csv`) in the `output` directory.  The specific output will depend on the data and analysis performed.  Further analysis and model building would follow using this cleaned dataset.
